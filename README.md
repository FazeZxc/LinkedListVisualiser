# Linked List Visualizer with Framer Motion Documentation

---

## Overview

The Linked List Visualizer with Framer Motion is a React-based web application that allows users to interactively create and manipulate linked lists visually. Leveraging the Framer Motion library, users can drag and drop nodes within a container, connect them to form a linked list, and observe real-time animations as they manipulate the data structure.

## Features

1. **Draggable Nodes**: Each node in the linked list is draggable, enabling users to rearrange the sequence of nodes within the container.

2. **Interactive Connections**: Users can visually connect nodes to form a linked list, observing animated lines between connected nodes.

3. **Node Creation and Deletion**: Functionality to add new nodes to the linked list and delete existing nodes is provided, allowing for dynamic manipulation of the data structure.

4. **Responsive Design**: The application is designed to be responsive, adapting to various screen sizes and orientations.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: The project is built using React, a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

- **Framer Motion**: Framer Motion is utilized for creating fluid animations and interactive elements, such as draggable nodes and animated connections between nodes.
